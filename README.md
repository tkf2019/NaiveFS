# NaiveFS
Naive file system based on fuse.
#### About FUSE

- File System in Userspace: the most widely used user-space file system framework.
- Provides simple API and easy to understand its internal architecture and implementation details.
- FUSE's kernel module registers a fuse file-system driver and a /dev/fuse block device (like a shared space between user daemon and kernel module for exchanging requests and responses).
- VFS will route file requests from userspace to registered fuse kernel driver. The kernel driver allocates a FUSE request structure and puts it in a FUSE queue. Process wait for the request handled by user daemon of fuse. Processing the request might require re-entering the kernel again:
  - In our implementation, we have to handle requests by accessing virtual disk `/dev/disk` to simulate real file system driver. So one request from user processes will at least trap into kernel 3 times: 1. user process submits request; 2. fuse user daemon (our file system) handles virtual disk; 3. fuse user daemon submits response.
  - The user process will be suspended until all the processes above is finished.
  - Crash may happens at any point of these processes, so we need to manage consistency and persistency.
- User-kernel protocol:
  - handle requests from FUSE's kernel driver which have a direct mapping to traditional VFS operations;
  - Request structure:
    - type
    - sequence number
    - node ID: an unsigned 64-bit integer
- FUSE request queues:
  - interrupts: INTERRUPT, 
  - forgets: FORGET (selected fairly with non-FORGET requests)
  - pending: synchronous requests (e.g., Metadata)
  - processing: the oldest pending request is moved to user space and the processing queue
  - background: asynchronous requests (read requests and write requests if the writeback cache is enabled)
